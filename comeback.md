# Make the Comeback of your Life

## 1. Go GHOST mode:
 No social media for validation. Every great man made moves in the shadows while none knew he was doing anything.. this is most powerful to avoid distractions from outside.. Not easy, muting outside noise leaves u with yourself & with your dark emotions u need to control.. the trauma.. that u distract with social media and games.. But u need to emr=brace it to level up And evolve

## 2. Learn a new skill
Something that earns u money and brings u safety (like a faceless youtube channels) learn them.. and earn... U dont need to learn everything. U dont need a million skills and be good at everything.. But just 1 good skill and master it (like take AI or Three.js or Quran) and get started fast
The FASTEST U GET STARTED THE SOONER U COMEBACK.. dont watch endless youtube vids... They are worth nothing if u dont put it into practice.. Put your single skill into as much practice

## 3. Productive vengence
(the first two are enough but this one is pro)
Seek revenge from your hates & enemies (not in a voilent way) but kill them with your success & achievements.. No be a snow flake... "you should only do it for yourself"... yes u doing it for yourself as it fuels your success..
It doesnt have to be a person.. if u see your family in tention... be angry to not to let that happen to your enemy again... like the time mom said no to more money
THen go on a mission to punish it with your sucess

## 4. The list of Greatness:
U must compete against yourself.. make a list of things of the man u want to become.. what are the qualities he has that u want to become.. write down to a list

Eg:
- Doesnt distract by cheap dopamine
- doesnt chase instant gatification but delayed gratification for bigger rewards
- Carries stress and problems other cant handle
- Controls his emotions 

And put it somehwree u see it so u are constantly reminded.... before u know it u will become that man

# All u need to RISE with the comeback:
1. No distractions
2. New skill
3. Endless Fuel
4. Constant reminding of the Direction
