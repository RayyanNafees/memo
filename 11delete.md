# 11 things to delete

## 1. LEt go of wrong people
U become who u spend time with, end the ones that are wrong, u are not obligated to be with them if it hurts, despite how much good time u spent with them.... If they hinder your life, or makes u feel pain, or stops u from growing, THEY NEED TO GO.. cut them off for loyalty to yourself.. no need to tell anyone, keep dignity, u dont need to give explanation to anyone

## 2. Dont Feel SORRY for YOURSELF
That makes us weaker and gets u excuses to fail
All successful ppl had it worse then u, they didnt do victim mindset, they used their pain to go through

##. # Constant use of Social MEdia

U can double your money and improve your life, but u can also degrade yourself.. U will watch others endlessly and that desrupts ypur mental health
It makes u jealous of others... 

Limit your use to it, like a library, go in, do your useful profuctive that u want, specific professional ones, at a specific time, and leave

edicate larger portion of to useful stuff.. be productive, not for wasting

Take enjoyment in the REAL WORLD, not on the virtual

##. 4. Self Doubt
Destroys confidence and makes u far from reaching your goals
"Bealiveing in yourself" doesnt work with Self Doubt.. Self-Doubt is jsut a thought... if u wanna be a millionare, u never had been, u will doubt your abilityies

Print a 2.0 version of yourself who had been a millionare already, list his abilities, and these are what u need, thats how u become him without self doubt

## 5. Let go of resentment
Some ppl have always a hatred deep in their heart keeping them away from Peace... (Hatred corrupts for soul)..dont put it too long or it will fuck u up

Learn to forgive others as a gift to yourself.. as forgivementss brings inner peace

## 6. Remove the Noise
Sometimes we need to mute the noise from the endless information u get from docs, blogs, news
NBe quite and kinda try thunk about nothing.. U will find soooo many solutions in silence

## 7. COmparing with others
Instead of focusing on yourself, u will be wasting enrgy on other
Everyones journey is unique
what works for u may not for him and vice versa

Instead of constantly comparing, focuss on your purpose & goals
it only brings unnecessary tst==
embrace your strengs and talents

Success and happiness isnt how u stack up against others but how intent u are with yourself

focusson your oiwn personal growth

## 8. Avoid Gossip
Its dark, when u speak badly of others u are indirectly assassinating his character, that negative words spread like wild fire
ask yourself would u like it to be said about you ?
Instead surround yourself with ppl who alue interactions, positivity and authentocity

Together create the productive conversational culuture u need to level up

## 9. Waiting for perfect moment
JUST START NOW !! Just do what u want instead of procrastinationg
The perfect moment never comes

## 10. Taking yourself VERY serious
U should be focussed when u want to achive your goals
Laugh and also enjoy life as u need a refreshments, dont forget to enjoy

## 11. Let go of the past
dont live int he past, its over and done with
the only reason to go back is if its lessoons to learn
after kearning is to move on
the most important moment of life is now, dont let go of the present
as u cant change the past, what u can change is RIGHT NOW
LIVE IN THE MOMENT
