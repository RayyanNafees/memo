# 1. Start with what the reader needs
have a section on why these docs are for

# 2. Write Less
Expect that what u writing may be useless

# 3. Write the outline first
Start with the outlimne, who  is this for, and what the user needs to read.
. and then use these as headings for your docs,
 then proceed from there fillling the details

# 4. Rubber ducking works for docs too
Speak before writing to get the content
Record eveerything u trying to explain and that will give u better content

# 5. Write readably
Apply readability technichues, make the doc structured with markdown
Make the docs as guidelines (directly telling people what to do)

# 6. It's not alwaysa about docs
U may not get smth fully in case they are hard, if instead of wtiting the doc u can fix the thing and make it easier to get, u should fix the thing
